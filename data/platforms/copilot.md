As of March 2026, **agents can call other agents as tools** (multi-agent coordination), and new agent surfaces include Outlook, OneDrive, and Teams communities."

### Changelog

| Date | Change |

| 2026-09-05 | [Verified] Copilot Pro row replaced by the Microsoft 365 consumer plans, all marked unavailable: agent authoring remains a commercial Copilot capability.

Free Copilot still doesn't include Office integration. Two catches: the AI benefits go to the **subscription owner only**, even on Family, and usage draws on monthly AI credits. **Copilot Pro no longer exists**, so ignore any guide that still names it."

### Talking Point

> "Copilot Vision lets Copilot watch your screen, a shared app, or your phone camera and talk you through what it sees. It runs inside a Copilot Voice session, so you share a screen and then ask out loud. It is **no longer free**: you now need **Microsoft 365 Personal, Family, or Premium**, capped at **10 minutes a day** on Personal and Family and **15 minutes a day** on Premium. It reaches well beyond Edge now, covering Windows, macOS, and the mobile apps."

### Talking Point

> "Copilot no longer sells access to a named GPT-4 tier, and Microsoft's own plan documentation never mentions one. What a **Microsoft 365 subscription buys is usage, not a better model**: higher limits, priority access when capacity is tight, and on **Premium** the advanced AI features and the Analyst and Researcher agents. Reporting through 2026 describes Copilot routing across newer OpenAI models alongside Microsoft's own MAI models, with a model picker on some surfaces. Any guide still framing this as free-versus-Pro GPT-4 access is out of date."

### Changelog

| Date | Change |
|------|--------|
| 2026-09-05 | [Verified] The GPT-4 framing is obsolete: Microsoft's plan documentation no longer sells a named model tier, and publishes no free-versus-paid model split. Gating changed from paid to mixed, since the paid differentiator is usage limits and advanced features rather than model access. Copilot Pro rows replaced with the Microsoft 365 consumer plans. Dead Copilot Pro store source replaced with Microsoft support pages. Multi-model routing across OpenAI and Microsoft MAI models is secondary reporting, not first-party confirmed. Record is a candidate for renaming away from "GPT-4 Access". |

Microsoft doesn't publish a monthly figure for free accounts. Powered by **GPT-Image-1.5**. The Designer bot in Teams was retired in February 2026, so use Copilot image generation instead."
