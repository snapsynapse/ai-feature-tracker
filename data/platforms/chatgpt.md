### Talking Point

> "Advanced voice is now **available on every plan, including free**—OpenAI's GPT-Live replaced the old Advanced Voice Mode as the default, with GPT-Live-1 mini for free accounts and GPT-Live-1 for paid. Free users get it on **web and mobile**; **voice in the macOS and Windows desktop apps is paid-only** and returned in July 2026 after being retired in January."

### Notes

**GPT-Live replaced Advanced Voice Mode (July 2026):**
OpenAI's GPT-Live is now the default ChatGPT voice experience. Per the GPT-Live system card, GPT-Live-1 is the default voice model for paid users and GPT-Live-1 mini for free users. The legacy Advanced Voice Mode remains reachable only as a fallback for features GPT-Live does not yet support (video and screen sharing) on web and mobile.

**Usage limits:** OpenAI publishes no per-tier numeric caps. The model release notes state only that "usage of advanced Voice (audio inputs and outputs) by Plus and Team users is limited on a daily basis." Limits are dynamic and surfaced in-app. Specific minute figures circulating in third-party guides are not OpenAI-confirmed.

**macOS desktop voice — retired then restored:**
- **January 15, 2026** — OpenAI retired all voice functionality from the ChatGPT macOS desktop app, to "focus on more unified and improved voice experiences across our apps." Voice remained on web, iOS, Android, and the Windows app.
- **July 23, 2026** — ChatGPT Voice returned to the desktop app on both macOS and Windows, powered by GPT-Live, rolling out globally to Plus, Pro, Business, Edu, and Enterprise plans. It integrates with ChatGPT Work and Codex for voice-directed agent control.

Free-tier users still have no desktop voice access and must use chatgpt.com or the mobile apps.

### Talking Point

> "Canvas is **being sunset**. OpenAI removed the split-screen Canvas interface from its GPT-5.5 flagship models (Instant and Thinking), replacing it with inline **writing blocks and code blocks** in the chat thread. Canvas **remains available by default in GPT-4o for all users including free**, and paid users can still reach it through legacy models—but that legacy path **ends when OpenAI o3 retires on August 26, 2026**."
